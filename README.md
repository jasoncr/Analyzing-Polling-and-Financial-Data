# python-challenge

In this challenge I wanted to analyze the profits and loss data from a hypothetical company. I wanted to answer the following questions: 

-How many months were recorded?

-What is the net total?

-What is the average change from one month to the next?

-What is the greatest increase from one month to the next and when did that happen?

-What is the greatest decrease from one month to the next and when did that happen?.

Therefore, I created a Python script that looped through the data and displayed the answers to these questions in a .txt file in my Analysis folder. Below is what that .txt file looks like.

To run the script, use the terminal. 



Week 3 homework for bootcamp. Looking at 2 data sets. 

-The first set the sample bank profits/loss data and the drawn analysis from the month to month summaries.

-The second is sample polling data and the drawn analysis from the voter information.
