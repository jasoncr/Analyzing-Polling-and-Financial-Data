# python-challenge

In this challenge I wanted to analyze the profits and loss data from a hypothetical company. I wanted to answer the following questions: 
-How many months were recorded?
-What is the net total?
-What is the average change from one month to the next?
-What is the greatest increase from one month to the next and when did that happen?
-What is the greatest decrease from one month to the next and when did that happen?.

Week 3 homework for bootcamp. Looking at 2 data sets. 

-The first set the sample bank profits/loss data and the drawn analysis from the month to month summaries.

-The second is sample polling data and the drawn analysis from the voter information.
